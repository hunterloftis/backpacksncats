<p>The view from our apartment&#39;s rooftop patio makes it tempting to bundle up and grill something soon.</p>
<h1 id="tragedy">Tragedy</h1>
<p>The last time we chose an apartment without knowing the city,
we ended up in the Tenderloin where <a href="http://abc7news.com/news/sf-man-stabbed-9-times-after-defending-his-girlfriend-/404960/">catcalling leads to brutal stabbings</a>.
For Washington, we booked a full month of AirBnB for $1,800 so we could scope out the area before signing a lease.
As you might imagine, it&#39;s tricky to score 31 days of pet-friendly, furnished, walkable
housing so we reserved our place four weeks in advance.</p>
<p>Just <em>three days</em> before our flight, the host canceled, leaving us stranded!
Her explanation: &quot;I just don&#39;t feel like it anymore.&quot;</p>
<p>AirBnB tried to help but was unable to find a walkable place that allowed cats anywhere nearby.
Damn.</p>
<p>Amanda and I scrambled to find a place to stay, with discouraging results.
Fortunately, she&#39;s much better at Craigslisting than I am (unless you want to find Nigerian scammers, in which case I&#39;m your man).
She somehow found a $1,500 sublet, in a gorgeous apartment complex, in one of Seattle&#39;s best neighborhoods (Capitol Hill).
We were hesitant - too good to be true and so on - but so far it&#39;s working out great!</p>

<p>Downstairs, the always-open lounge provides a big-screen TV and plenty of workspace with free wifi.
So far, we&#39;ve gotten away without hooking up Internet at the new place.
Side effect: less Facebooking, more actual facetime together.</p>

<p>The apartment itself is simple but nice.
I don&#39;t love carpet, but it&#39;s cozier than hardwoods during Seattle&#39;s freezing nights.</p>

<p>Fatty&#39;s already at home.</p>
