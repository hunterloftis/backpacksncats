<p>We&#39;ll probably miss the place eventually. We miss the people already.</p>
<h1 id="out-of-sf">Out of SF</h1>
<p>I pulled at the tether of San Francisco for most of the year we lived
there until - finally - we escaped! We missed our friends immediately, so it was a bittersweet
escape, but I expect we&#39;ll cross paths frequently and soon.
(Seattle is beautiful - come visit!)</p>
<p>Sometimes a place just rubs you the wrong way, and that&#39;s how it was with us and SF.
Partly, our bad experiences stemmed from the Tenderloin, the seedy neighborhood in which we found our &quot;affordable&quot; $2,600 apartment.
In the Tenderloin, walking became an exercise of balance: watching for shit and refuse
on the sidewalk while also avoiding the paths of angry junkies and naked folks rifling through trash cans.
Drug exchanges, self-injections from needles between toes, and furious rants at the world became everyday sights.
We had to call the police twice, once while chasing down a burglar and again when a neighbor was assaulted by her husband.
Amanda felt unsafe walking alone and I sometimes carried a knife at night.</p>

</ul>
<p>It isn&#39;t just the Tenderloin that pushed us away, though.
The whole city sent signals through price and policy that shouted &quot;LEAVE!&quot;
Apartments in nicer neighborhoods started around $3,200.
Our <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/mosser-companies-san-francisco">horrible landlord</a>
had no incentive to be responsive since our absence would give them an open spot,
fillable immediately, with a rate increase of several hundred dollars.
10.8% of our income was &quot;redistributed&quot; and what was left was eaten by
$600 towing fees, $11 sandwiches, and countless Lyft rides in this walkable-but-not-really city.</p>
