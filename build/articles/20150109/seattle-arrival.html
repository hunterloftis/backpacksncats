<p>The view from our apartment&#39;s rooftop patio makes it tempting to bundle up and grill something soon.</p>
<h1 id="into-washington">Into Washington</h1>
<p>So we went north - to Seattle, another big city that&#39;s frequently compared to SF.
However, we&#39;ve found that Seattle &#39;full-asses&#39; a lot of things SF half-asses:
it&#39;s legitimately walkable, its public transportation covers more than just a single cooridoor,
and its citizens are more grungy than trendy, which suits me just fine.
Also, while Seattle hosts plenty of tech-heads, we&#39;re part of a much more colorful canvas here.</p>
<p>Neither of us have ever visited America&#39;s north-west, one reason to come here.
We plan to explore the area a little - Vancouver, Bellingham, snowboarding at Mt. Baker.
I&#39;d like to convince Amanda to take a road/camping trip with me to Yellowstone when it gets warmer.
(I&#39;ll bet we could convince some of our outdoorsy friends to join too)</p>
<p>Washington also remains one of the seven bastions of zero-income-tax states.
Since California and SF have super-aggressive tax policies,
we&#39;ll save more than $1,000 each month just by getting their grubby hands out of our paychecks.
The Numbeo cost of living plus rent index for San Francisco is 96 while Seattle is 75,
so we expect to save in other areas as well (rent, groceries, restaurants).</p>
<h1 id="tragedy-and-our-new-apartment">Tragedy, and our new apartment</h1>
<p>Four weeks ago, we reserved a full month of AirBnB for $1,800 so that we could explore Bellingham and Seattle
(hopefully avoiding another Tenderloin situation).
However, just <em>three days</em> before our flight, the host canceled, leaving us stranded!</p>
<p><em>(her reason: &quot;I just don&#39;t feel like it anymore.&quot;)</em></p>
<p>AirBnB tried to help but was unable to find a walkable place that allowed cats anywhere nearby.
Damn.
Amanda and I scrambled to find a place to stay, with discouraging results.
Fortunately, she&#39;s much better at Craigslisting than I am (unless you want to find Nigerian scammers, in which case I&#39;m your man).
She somehow found a $1,500 sublet, in a gorgeous apartment complex, in one of Seattle&#39;s best neighborhoods (Capitol Hill).
What&#39;s the catch? We don&#39;t know yet, so far it&#39;s working out great!</p>

<p>Downstairs, the always-open lounge provides a big-screen TV and plenty of workspace with free wifi.
So far, we&#39;ve gotten away without hooking up Internet at the new place.
Side effect: less Facebooking, more actual facetime together.</p>

<p>The apartment itself is great.
I don&#39;t love carpet, but it&#39;s cozier than hardwoods during Seattle&#39;s freezing nights.</p>

<p>Fatty&#39;s already at home.</p>
